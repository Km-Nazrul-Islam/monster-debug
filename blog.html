                    occurrence of an event. <strong>JavaScript</strong> is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting language, widely used for controlling
                    web page behavior.</p>

                            The difference between <strong>localStorage</strong> and <strong>sessionStorage</strong> has to do with lifetime and scope: how long the data is saved for
                            and who the data is accessible to. <strong>Session storage</strong> is destroyed once the user closes the browser whereas, <strong>Local storage</strong>
                            stores data with no expiration date. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>localStorage</strong> and <strong>sessionStorage</strong> are relatively new APIs (meaning, not all legacy browsers will support them) and are
                            near identical (both in APIs and capabilities) with the sole exception of persistence. sessionStorage (as the name
                            suggests) is only available for the duration of the browser session (and is deleted when the tab or window is closed) -
                            it does, however, survive page reloads

                            1. Global Scope: A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL. A global variable has <strong>global scope</strong>: All scripts and functions on
                            a web page can access it.

                                2. Block Scope: <strong>Block scope</strong> is the area within if, switch conditions or for and while loops. Generally speaking, whenever you see {curly
                                brackets}, it is a block. In ES6, const and let keywords allow developers to declare variables in the block scope, which
                                means those variables exist only within the corresponding block.

                            The <strong>Event Loop</strong> has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the
                           <strong>Event Loop</strong> will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such
                            an iteration is called a tick in the <strong>Event Loop</strong>.

                            <br>
                            6. Accessing array elements utside of the index range will give undefined.

                            <br>
